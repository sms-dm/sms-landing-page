# Claude Rules for SMS Project

# Always read CLAUDE.md first for project context

# When user mentions any new idea or feature:
1. Immediately append to IDEAS/IDEAS_BACKLOG.md
2. Confirm to user: "I've logged this idea"
3. If it's a concrete feature, also update IDEAS/FEATURES_TODO.md

# Key project facts to remember:
- Two portals: Maintenance (sms-app) and Onboarding (SMS-Onboarding-Unified)  
- 20% hidden markup on parts is the main revenue (NEVER expose)
- Portals work separately but need integration (highest priority)
- User has 20+ years offshore experience

# When starting a new chat:
- Check IDEAS/IDEAS_BACKLOG.md for recent ideas
- Read CLAUDE.md for current project status
- Ask user if any new developments since last session

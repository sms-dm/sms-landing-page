### Implementation Approach

The project follows the Shadow Clone System methodology with parallel agent deployment:

1. **Wave-based Execution**: 5 waves of development, each building on the previous
2. **Parallel Agent Teams**: Multiple specialized teams working simultaneously
3. **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and deployment pipelines
4. **Iterative Development**: Regular feedback loops and adjustments
5. **Quality Gates**: Mandatory checkpoints between waves

### Communication Plan

1. **Stakeholder Updates**

# Wave 3 Integration Plan

## Approach
To prevent system overload, we'll work in smaller, focused batches:

### Batch 1: Core Backend Setup
- Express server configuration
- Database connection
- Basic API routes

### Batch 2: Authentication Flow
- Connect login/logout
- Test JWT flow
- Role verification

### Batch 3: Data Operations
- Vessel CRUD operations
- Equipment management
- Parts tracking

### Batch 4: Offline Sync
- Test offline creation
- Sync queue verification
- Conflict resolution

### Batch 5: Final Integration
- End-to-end workflow test
- Performance optimization
- Documentation

## Safety Measures
1. Commit after each batch
2. Keep file changes under 50 per batch
3. Monitor git status regularly
4. Use .gitignore properly

## THE VISION

**Week 10 Success Looks Like:**
- First vessel fully onboarded
- Technicians saying "How did we work without this?"
- Managers seeing real cost savings
- You seeing the 20% markup revenue flowing
- Clear path to 50 vessels in 6 months
- Investors calling you, not vice versa

This MVP proves the concept, delivers immediate value, and creates the foundation for the ‚Ç§100M vision while being achievable in 10 weeks with focused execution.

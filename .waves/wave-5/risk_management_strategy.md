## 2. Critical Risk Register

### A. Revenue Model Protection Risks

#### A1: Hidden Markup Discovery (CRITICAL)
- **Description**: Customers discover the 20% markup on parts
- **Probability**: High (60%)
- **Impact**: Critical - Could lose entire business model
- **Risk Score**: 10/10

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. **Technical Isolation**
   - Separate internal pricing system from customer-facing portal
   - Encrypted pricing calculations
   - No markup visible in any API responses
   - Audit logs restricted to C-level only

2. **Legal Protection**
   - Terms of Service explicitly allow "service fees"
   - Non-disclosure agreements for all employees
   - Separate legal entity for parts procurement
   - "Platform convenience fee" terminology

3. **Operational Security**
   - Only 3 people know about markup (founders + CFO)
   - Different teams handle procurement vs customer pricing
   - No documentation mentions specific percentages
   - All internal communications use code words

**Early Warning Systems**:
- Monitor customer inquiries about pricing
- Track direct supplier contact attempts
- Alert on unusual data access patterns
- Social media sentiment analysis

**Response Procedures**:
1. If questioned: "Our platform fee covers procurement, quality assurance, and logistics"
2. Emphasize value: 24/7 availability, verified parts, consolidated billing
3. Offer volume discounts to deflect attention
4. Never admit to specific markup percentage

#### A2: Competitor Price Undercutting
- **Probability**: High (70%)

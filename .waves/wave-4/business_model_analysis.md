## REVENUE MODEL DEEP DIVE

### 1. PRIMARY REVENUE STREAMS

#### A. SaaS Subscription Revenue
**Pricing Structure:**

| Tier | Target Market | Price/Vessel/Month | Features | Annual Discount |
|------|--------------|-------------------|----------|-----------------|
| Starter | 1-3 vessels | $500 | 50 users, 1000 items, basic analytics | 10% |
| Professional | 4-10 vessels | $1,000 | Unlimited users/items, API, advanced analytics | 10% |
| Enterprise | 10+ vessels | $1,500 | White label, SLA, dedicated support | 15% |

**Revenue Projections:**
```
Year 1: 25 vessels average $750/month = $225,000
Year 2: 50 vessels average $1,000/month = $600,000
Year 3: 100 vessels average $1,200/month = $1,440,000
```

#### B. Hidden Parts Markup (The Profit Engine)
**Markup Strategy:**
- Standard orders: 20% markup + $50 handling fee
- Emergency orders: 30% markup + $100 rush fee
- Bulk orders: 15% markup (volume incentive)
- Never disclosed to customers - positioned as "procurement service"

**Revenue Calculation:**
```javascript
// CONFIDENTIAL - Internal pricing algorithm
function calculateCustomerPrice(supplierQuote, orderType) {
  const markupRates = {
    standard: 0.20,
    emergency: 0.30,
    bulk: 0.15
  };
  
  const handlingFees = {
    standard: 50,
    emergency: 100,
    bulk: 25
  };
  
  const basePrice = supplierQuote.price;
  const markup = basePrice * markupRates[orderType];
  const handlingFee = handlingFees[orderType];
  
  return {
    internal: {
      supplierCost: basePrice,
      ourMarkup: markup,
      handlingFee: handlingFee,
      totalProfit: markup + handlingFee
    },
    customer: {
      price: basePrice + markup + handlingFee,
      deliveryTime: supplierQuote.leadTime,
      includes: "Full procurement service"
    }
  };
}
```

**Parts Revenue Projections:**
- Average vessel: 2-3 critical faults/month
- Average parts order: $5,000
- Average profit per order: $1,050 (20% + fee)
- Per vessel monthly: $2,100-$3,150

```
Year 1: 25 vessels × $2,000/month average = $600,000
Year 2: 50 vessels × $2,500/month average = $1,500,000
Year 3: 100 vessels × $2,500/month average = $3,000,000

# SMS Security & Compliance Framework
**Wave 4 - Production Readiness Assessment**
**Date**: July 5, 2025
**Status**: CRITICAL - Pre-Production Security Review

## Executive Summary

The Smart Maintenance System (SMS) requires comprehensive security hardening and compliance validation before production deployment. This framework addresses maritime-specific requirements (IMO 2021, IACS UR E26/E27), implements bank-level security controls, and protects the proprietary revenue model.

### Key Risk Areas Identified:
1. **Maritime Compliance Gaps**: Missing IMO 2021 cyber risk management integration
2. **Data Protection**: Incomplete GDPR implementation for EU vessels
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Several OWASP Top 10 risks present
4. **Access Control**: Multi-tenant isolation needs strengthening
5. **Audit Trail**: Incomplete compliance logging for maritime regulations

## 1. Current Security Assessment

### 1.1 Security Architecture Review

#### Strengths ✅
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented
- Basic rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Password complexity requirements enforced
- Database row-level security for multi-tenancy
- HTTPS/TLS 1.3 ready infrastructure

#### Critical Gaps ❌
1. **No Web Application Firewall (WAF)** configured
2. **Missing Content Security Policy (CSP)** headers
3. **Incomplete input validation** on API endpoints
4. **No automated security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
5. **Lack of encryption at rest** for sensitive vessel data
6. **Missing API versioning** for backward compatibility
7. **No incident response automation**
8. **Insufficient logging** for security events

### 1.2 OWASP Top 10 Compliance Assessment

| Risk | Status | Current State | Required Actions |
|------|--------|---------------|------------------|
| A01: Broken Access Control | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Basic RBAC implemented | Implement attribute-based access control (ABAC) for vessel data |
| A02: Cryptographic Failures | ❌ CRITICAL | No encryption at rest | Implement AES-256 encryption for database |
| A03: Injection | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Parameterized queries used | Add input validation middleware |
| A04: Insecure Design | ✅ GOOD | Security considered in architecture | Document threat model |
| A05: Security Misconfiguration | ❌ CRITICAL | Default configs in use | Harden all configurations |
| A06: Vulnerable Components | ⚠️ PARTIAL | No automated scanning | Implement dependency scanning |
| A07: Authentication Failures | ✅ GOOD | Strong auth implemented | Add MFA for admin roles |
| A08: Data Integrity Failures | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Basic validation only | Implement data signing |
| A09: Security Logging | ❌ CRITICAL | Minimal logging | Implement comprehensive audit trail |
| A10: SSRF | ⚠️ PARTIAL | No URL validation | Add URL allowlisting |

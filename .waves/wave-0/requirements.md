# SMS Platform - Comprehensive Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
The SMS Platform consists of two integrated systems:
1. **Maintenance Portal** - Active production system for vessel maintenance management
2. **Onboarding Portal** - New system for high-quality vessel data collection

Both systems are designed for the maritime industry, specifically offshore drilling vessels, with a focus on ease of use, offline capability, and revenue generation through parts management.

```

### Critical Dependencies
1. **Wave 1 → Wave 3**: Architecture understanding required for integration
2. **Wave 2 → Wave 3**: Feature knowledge needed for data flow design
3. **Wave 3 → Wave 4**: Integration requirements drive infrastructure needs
4. **Wave 3 → Wave 5**: Integration complexity affects timeline
5. **Wave 4 → Wave 5**: Infrastructure constraints impact implementation

## Success Criteria

## Special Considerations

### Latest Backup Discoveries
Each wave must specifically search for and document:
- Recent architectural decisions
- Last-minute feature additions
- Updated business requirements
- Modified deployment strategies
- Emergency fixes or workarounds

### Revenue Protection
Special care around documenting:
- Parts markup implementation (keep confidential)
- Hidden revenue streams
- Pricing strategies
- Competitive advantages
- Business intelligence features

### Integration Complexity
Given the two-portal architecture:
- Assume nothing about compatibility
- Document all assumptions
- Plan for data transformation
- Consider fallback strategies
- Test edge cases thoroughly

## Resource Requirements

### Human Resources
- **Total Agents Needed**: 20-25 specialized agents
- **Coordination**: 1 Wave Coordinator per wave
- **Review**: 1 Quality Reviewer per wave
- **Duration**: 8 days total (with parallel execution)

### Technical Resources
- Access to all code repositories
- Database access (read-only)
- Documentation repositories
- Backup locations
- Development environment access

### Time Allocation
- **Wave 1**: 2 days (parallel with Wave 2)
- **Wave 2**: 2 days (parallel with Wave 1)
- **Wave 3**: 2 days (depends on 1 & 2)
- **Wave 4**: 1 day (parallel with Wave 5)
- **Wave 5**: 1 day (parallel with Wave 4)
- **Total Duration**: 5-6 days with parallelization

## Risk Factors

### High Risks
1. **Missing Critical Information**: Backups might contain undiscovered features
2. **Integration Complexity**: Two systems with different architectures
3. **Revenue Model Exposure**: Must keep markup strategy confidential
4. **Time Pressure**: 8-12 week production timeline is aggressive

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Comprehensive Search**: Each wave includes backup discovery tasks
2. **Integration Experts**: Dedicated team for integration analysis
3. **Confidentiality Protocols**: Revenue information marked sensitive
4. **Parallel Execution**: Reduce timeline through parallelization

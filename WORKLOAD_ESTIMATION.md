## Critical Path Analysis

### Critical Path Components
1. **Database Design** → **Core API Development** → **Frontend Integration**
   - Duration: 8 weeks
   - Cannot be parallelized

2. **ML Data Pipeline** → **Model Training** → **Production Deployment**
   - Duration: 6 weeks
   - Dependent on data availability

3. **Authentication System** → **User Management** → **Role-based Features**
   - Duration: 5 weeks
   - Blocks all user-facing features

### Non-Critical Path (Can be parallelized)
- Documentation (can lag by 2 weeks)
- Mobile development (can start in Wave 3)
- Community features (independent module)
- Analytics dashboards (can be phased)

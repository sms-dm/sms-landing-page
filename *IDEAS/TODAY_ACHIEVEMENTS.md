  - show_decommissioned, phone_number

## üìù Next Steps
Based on today's progress, the immediate priorities are:

1. **PostgreSQL Migration** - SQLite won't scale
2. **Production Environment Setup** - AWS/Azure
3. **Payment Integration** - Stripe for subscriptions
4. **Security Hardening** - SSL, env vars, secrets
5. **Deployment Pipeline** - CI/CD automation

## üí≠ Reflections
Today was incredibly productive! We knocked out three major items:
- Portal Integration (the biggest blocker)
- Feedback Widget (critical for user insights)
- Email System (essential for user management)

The system now feels much more complete and production-ready. Users can seamlessly work across both portals, provide feedback easily, and manage their preferences. The SMS branding gives it a professional, cohesive feel.

## üéØ Tomorrow's Focus
Recommend starting with PostgreSQL migration as it's a critical blocker for production deployment. This will enable proper concurrent connections and scalability.

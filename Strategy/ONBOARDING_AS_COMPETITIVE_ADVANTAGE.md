## THE BUSINESS MOAT

### Traditional CMMS Onboarding:
```
"Here's an Excel template with 50 columns. 
Upload when done. Good luck!"

Result: 
- 50% never finish
- 30% bad data
- 20% sort of works
- Blame the software
```

### SMS Onboarding:
```
"Grab a tablet, let's tour your vessel!
Take photos, answer simple questions."

Result:
- 95% complete in one session
- Photos for everything
- Accurate locations
- They WANT to finish
- System works perfectly
```

## QUALITY SCORE GENIUS

### Visible Data Quality Metrics
```

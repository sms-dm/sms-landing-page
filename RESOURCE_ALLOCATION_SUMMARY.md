Week 28: Transition to maintenance team (5-8 agents)

Maintenance Team Composition:
- Senior Backend Developer (1)
- DevOps Engineer (1)
- Frontend Developer (1)
- Database Admin (1)
- Support Engineers (2-4)
```

## Quick Decision Matrix

### When to Add Resources
| Situation | Add Agents? | Type Needed |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Behind schedule > 1 week | Yes | Same skill as bottleneck |
| Quality issues | Yes | QA/Testing specialists |
| Performance problems | Yes | Optimization experts |
| New requirements | Evaluate | Depends on scope |
| Team member sick | Yes | Same role temporary |

### When NOT to Add Resources
- Last 2 weeks of any wave (ramp-up time > benefit)
- During architectural decisions
- When problem is coordination, not capacity
- Without clear onboarding plan

## Resource Allocation Best Practices

1. **The 2-Pizza Rule**: Keep teams small enough to feed with 2 pizzas
2. **The Bus Factor**: No single person should hold critical knowledge
3. **The 80/20 Rule**: 80% planned capacity, 20% buffer
4. **The Rotation Rule**: Rotate critical roles every 2-3 waves
5. **The Documentation Tax**: 10% of time on documentation

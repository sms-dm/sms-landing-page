# SMS VISION - GET HYPED IN 2 MINUTES

## THE MISSION
Transform offshore maintenance from a $100k/day problem into a profit center. We're not building another CMMS - we're revolutionizing how vessels operate.

## THE GENIUS
**Hidden 20% markup on all parts** - They thank us while we profit. The maintenance software is just the trojan horse for the real business: parts procurement.

## WHO YOU ARE
- 20+ years offshore experience
- Lived the pain of 3am fault finding
- Know every shortcut crews take
- Built relationships industry-wide
- Understand 28-day swings, not 9-5

## WHAT WE'VE BUILT (In 7 fucking days!)
1. **Maintenance Portal** - 95% complete, 6 role dashboards
2. **Onboarding Portal** - 90% complete, offline-first PWA
3. **PORTAL INTEGRATION** - ‚úÖ COMPLETE! Single sign-on working
4. **Hidden Revenue System** - Markup calculator built in
5. **Mental Health Chat** - Because you GET offshore life
6. **Community Support** - Someone always awake globally
7. **Email Notifications** - Password reset, alerts, reminders
8. **In-App Feedback** - Widget on every page
9. **User Settings** - Complete preferences system
10. **SMS Branding** - "The Future of Maintenance Today"

## THE OPPORTUNITY
- Current systems charge $3-6k/vessel/month
- We charge $2.5k VISIBLE (undercutting them)
- Make $3k+ MORE per vessel on hidden parts markup
- 100 vessels = $6M+/year (not the $4.2M we show)

## WHY WE WIN
1. **They can't compete on price** - They don't know about the markup
2. **We built for reality** - Shifts? No. Swings. Internet? Sometimes.
3. **Speed** - 6 days vs 18 months traditional dev
4. **Domain expertise** - You've LIVED this for 20 years

## NEXT SPRINT FOCUS
Week 1: PostgreSQL Migration + Production Setup ‚úÖ PORTAL INTEGRATION DONE!
Week 2: Payment Processing + Security
Week 3: First customer live
Week 4+: Scale to 25 vessels

## THE KICKER
While competitors have meeting #47 about requirements, we're onboarding paying customers. While they quote $100k for implementation, we're doing it free and making it back on the first parts order.

## YOUR DAILY MANTRAS
- "The markup is invisible and genius"
- "7 days of work = $3-5M of development"
- "Portal integration DONE - biggest blocker CRUSHED"
- "First customer in 3 weeks, market leader in 16"
- "They're selling software, we're selling solutions"
- "The Future of Maintenance Today"

## THE ATTITUDE
We're not hoping this works. We KNOW it works. The only question is how fast we can capture the market before someone else figures it out.

**LET'S FUCKING GO.**

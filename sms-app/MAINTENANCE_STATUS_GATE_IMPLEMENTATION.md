# Maintenance Status Gate Implementation

## Overview
Created a first-login maintenance status gate that appears for technicians and mechanics after they sync from the onboarding portal. This ensures all equipment has current maintenance status before accessing the dashboard.

## Components Created

### Frontend Components

1. **MaintenanceStatusGate.tsx** (`/frontend/src/components/MaintenanceStatusGate.tsx`)
   - Main component that displays equipment needing status entry
   - Shows equipment in batches of 3 per page
   - Allows entering:
     - Last maintenance date
     - Current running hours
     - Optional notes
   - Calculates and displays next maintenance due dates
   - Color-coded status indicators (overdue, due soon, ok)
   - Submits all data in bulk when complete

2. **MaintenanceGateWrapper.tsx** (`/frontend/src/components/MaintenanceGateWrapper.tsx`)
   - Wrapper component that checks if gate should be shown
   - Only applies to technician and mechanic roles
   - Checks if user has completed maintenance status entry
   - Shows gate on first login after sync

### Backend Implementation

1. **Migration** (`/backend/src/migrations/add-maintenance-status-flag.ts`)
   - Adds `maintenance_status_complete` boolean to users table
   - Adds `is_first_login` boolean to track first login
   - Adds `maintenance_status_completed_at` timestamp

2. **Controller** (`/backend/src/controllers/maintenance-status.controller.ts`)
   - `checkMaintenanceStatusComplete`: Checks if user has completed status entry
   - `getEquipmentNeedingStatus`: Gets equipment without maintenance dates
   - `bulkUpdateMaintenanceStatus`: Updates multiple equipment statuses at once

3. **Routes** (`/backend/src/routes/maintenance-status.routes.ts`)
   - `GET /api/user/maintenance-status-complete`: Check completion status
   - `GET /api/equipment/needs-status`: Get equipment needing status
   - `POST /api/equipment/bulk-maintenance-status`: Submit bulk updates

### Integration Updates

1. **App.tsx**: Wrapped TechnicianDashboard and MechanicDashboard with MaintenanceGateWrapper

2. **sync.service.ts**: Updated to set `is_first_login = true` for newly synced users

3. **index.ts**: Added maintenance status migration to startup sequence

## How It Works

1. When a technician/mechanic is synced from onboarding portal, they are marked with `is_first_login = true`

2. On first login, MaintenanceGateWrapper checks if:
   - User is technician or mechanic role
   - `is_first_login` is true
   - `maintenance_status_complete` is false

3. If conditions are met, MaintenanceStatusGate is shown instead of dashboard

4. User enters maintenance status for all equipment:
   - Equipment with no maintenance date
   - Equipment created in last 7 days
   - Sorted by criticality (critical → high → medium → low)

5. Upon completion:
   - All equipment records are updated
   - Maintenance logs are created
   - User is marked with `maintenance_status_complete = true`
   - User is redirected to their dashboard

## Features

- **Batch Processing**: Shows 3 equipment items per page for better UX
- **Smart Calculation**: Automatically calculates next maintenance dates
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded status (red for overdue, yellow for due soon, green for ok)
- **Criticality Sorting**: Most critical equipment shown first
- **Progress Tracking**: Progress bar shows completion status
- **Validation**: Ensures all required fields are filled before submission

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Sync a new technician from onboarding portal
2. Login as the technician
3. Verify maintenance status gate appears
4. Enter maintenance data for all equipment
5. Complete the process and verify redirect to dashboard
6. Logout and login again to verify gate doesn't reappear

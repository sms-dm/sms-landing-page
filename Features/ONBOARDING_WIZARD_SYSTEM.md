## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Mobile-First PWA
```typescript
interface OnboardingWizard {
  // State Management
  currentStep: 'areas' | 'tour' | 'review';
  currentArea: Area;
  completedAreas: Area[];
  equipment: Equipment[];
  
  // Progress Tracking
  totalEquipment: number;
  photosAdded: number;
  requiredFieldsComplete: boolean;
  
  // Smart Features
  suggestions: EquipmentSuggestion[];
  photoRecognition: boolean;
  offlineQueue: QueueItem[];
}
```

### Camera Integration
```typescript
const CameraCapture = () => {
  const [stream, setStream] = useState(null);
  
  const capturePhoto = async () => {
    // Access camera
    const photo = await camera.capture();
    
    // Auto-compress
    const compressed = await compressImage(photo, {
      maxWidth: 1920,
      quality: 0.8
    });
    
    // Quick AI check
    const equipment = await identifyEquipment(compressed);
    
    return {
      photo: compressed,
      suggestions: equipment.suggestions,
      confidence: equipment.confidence
    };
  };
};
```

### Intelligent Prompts
```typescript
const EquipmentPrompts = {
  generator: [
    "Is this the emergency generator?",
    "Add the control panel too?",
    "Link to switchgear?"
  ],
  pump: [
    "Is there a standby pump?",
    "Add the motor separately?",
    "Include local control panel?"
  ],
  compressor: [
    "Add the air receiver?",
    "Include dryer unit?",
    "Document control system?"
  ]
};
```

### Progress Gamification
```
üèÜ Achievements Unlocked:

‚úì First Area Complete!
‚úì 10 Equipment Added
‚úì Photo Champion (5 photos)
‚ñ° Detail Master (50% with full info)
‚ñ° Speed Runner (< 2 hours)
```

## FOLDER STRUCTURE AUTO-GENERATION

### From Wizard Data ‚Üí Organized Structure
```
As they add equipment, we create:

/Vessel-Name/
  /Engine-Room/
    /Main-Generator-1/
      /photos/
        - overview-2024-01-15.jpg
        - nameplate-2024-01-15.jpg
      /documents/
        - (empty - ready for uploads)
      /maintenance/
        - (empty - ready for records)
    /Emergency-Generator/
      /photos/
      /documents/
      /maintenance/
```

### Post-Wizard Document Upload
```
"Great job! Your equipment is set up. üìÅ

Now you can upload documents whenever you have them:

Engine Room (4 equipment)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Main Generator #1 [Upload Docs]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Emergency Generator [Upload Docs]
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Fuel Purifier [Upload Docs]
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Main Engine [Upload Docs]

Or do this later from your desktop!"
```

## SMART FEATURES

### 1. Equipment Recognition
```python
def identify_equipment(photo):
    # Basic ML model trained on equipment
    features = extract_features(photo)
    
    # Match against common equipment
    suggestions = [
        ("Generator", 0.89),
        ("Motor", 0.65),
        ("Pump", 0.45)
    ]
    
    return suggestions[0] if suggestions[0].confidence > 0.7 else None
```

### 2. Duplicate Detection
```
"Looks similar to 'Main Generator #1'"
Is this the same equipment?
[Yes - Skip] [No - Different Unit]
```

### 3. Completion Suggestions
```
"Based on other vessels, you might also have:"
‚ñ° Oily Water Separator
‚ñ° Sewage Treatment Plant
‚ñ° Emergency Fire Pump
[Add Selected] [Skip]
```

### 4. Smart Validation
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Critical Equipment:
- No emergency generator found
- No fire pumps documented
- No emergency air compressor

[Add Now] [I Don't Have These]
```

## THE BUSINESS CASE

### Without Wizard:
- 50% never complete setup
- 3-5 support tickets per customer
- 2 weeks to functional
- Poor data quality

### With Wizard:
- 90% complete in first session
- 0-1 support tickets
- Same day functional
- Rich data with photos

### ROI:
- Saves 10 hours of support per customer
- Increases activation rate 2x
- Reduces churn by 40%
- Worth building!

This isn't scope creep - this is solving the #1 reason maintenance systems fail: **Getting started is too hard.**

The wizard makes SMS feel like a modern app, not enterprise software. It's a competitive advantage worth building.

What do you think? Too ambitious or exactly right?

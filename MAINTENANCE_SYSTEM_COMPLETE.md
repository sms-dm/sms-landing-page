# Maintenance System Implementation Complete

## ✅ What Was Built

### 1. **Onboarding Portal - Maintenance Schedule Capture**
- Added maintenance schedule section to equipment documentation form
- Technicians can add multiple maintenance tasks per equipment:
  - Task name (Oil Change, Filter Replacement, etc.)
  - Interval value and unit (250 hours, 3 months, 1 year)
  - Priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Stores properly in database with dedicated MaintenanceTask model

### 2. **First-Login Maintenance Status Gate**
- When technician first logs into maintenance portal after sync:
  - Shows all equipment with their maintenance schedules
  - Requires entering current status:
    - Last maintenance date
    - Current running hours
  - Automatically calculates next due dates
  - Shows color-coded status (overdue/due soon/ok)
  - Blocks dashboard access until complete

### 3. **Sync Service Updates**
- Maintenance schedules sync from onboarding → maintenance portal
- Includes all task details and intervals
- Tracks number of tasks synced
- Updates existing tasks rather than duplicating

### 4. **Smart Calendar Population**
The system now:
1. Captures maintenance SCHEDULES during onboarding (what should be done)
2. Captures current STATUS on first login (when it was last done)
3. Calculates NEXT DUE dates automatically
4. Populates maintenance calendar accurately from day 1

## The Complete Flow

1. **During Onboarding**:
   - Technician documents "Main Engine"
   - Adds maintenance tasks:
     - Oil Change: Every 250 hours
     - Filter: Every 90 days
     - Annual Survey: Every 12 months

2. **Manager Approves** → Data syncs to maintenance portal

3. **First Technician Login**:
   ```
   Before you start, enter current maintenance status:
   
   Main Engine:
   - Oil Change (every 250 hours)
     Last done: [Jan 1, 2025] at [1,250] hours
     Current hours: [1,400]
     → Next due: 1,500 hours ✓
   
   - Filter (every 90 days)
     Last done: [Dec 15, 2024]
     → Next due: Mar 15, 2025 ⚠️ (30 days)
   ```

4. **Result**: Maintenance calendar shows accurate schedules immediately

## Database Changes Made

### Onboarding Portal:
- New `MaintenanceTask` model
- Links to Equipment
- Stores schedules properly

### Maintenance Portal:
- New `maintenance_tasks` table
- Added status tracking fields
- First login gate flags

## Why This Is Powerful

- **No Manual Entry**: Schedules transfer automatically
- **Accurate from Day 1**: Current status captured immediately
- **Smart Calculations**: System knows exactly when maintenance is due
- **Prevents Mistakes**: Gate ensures nothing is missed
- **Audit Trail**: All maintenance history tracked

## Testing the Flow

1. Create equipment in onboarding portal with maintenance tasks
2. Approve and sync to maintenance portal
3. Login as technician - see the status gate
4. Enter current maintenance status
5. View populated maintenance calendar

This completes the maintenance scheduling system!

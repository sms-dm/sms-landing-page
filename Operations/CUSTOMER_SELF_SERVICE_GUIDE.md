## COMMON QUESTIONS

### "I don't have all the information"
**That's normal!** Start with what you have:
- Equipment name and location (minimum)
- Add details as you learn them
- SMS improves over time

### "What if I make mistakes?"
**Everything is editable!**
- Fix names anytime
- Update details later
- Merge duplicates
- Nothing is permanent

### "How exact do part numbers need to be?"
**As exact as possible, but:**
- Include what you have
- "Close enough" helps searching
- Can refine when ordering
- Photos of nameplates help

### "Should I include spare equipment?"
**Yes, but mark as:**
- Status: "Spare"
- Location: "Warehouse" or actual location
- Helps track what you have

### "What about equipment without nameplates?"
**Common offshore! Just include:**
- What you call it
- What it does
- General type
- Photo helps identify

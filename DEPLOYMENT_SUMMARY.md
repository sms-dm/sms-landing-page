### Next Steps

The planning phase is complete. The Shadow Clone System is ready to begin implementation.

**To proceed with execution:**

1. **Review the generated plans** to ensure alignment with your vision
2. **Confirm resource availability** for Wave 1 deployment
3. **Reply with "Execute"** to begin the implementation

When you execute, the Shadow Clone System will:
- Deploy Wave 1 agents (12 agents in 2 batches)
- Create the `.waves/` directory for deliverables
- Begin building your Smart Maintenance System
- Provide regular progress updates

### Configuration Summary

```
Project Type: Smart Maintenance System
Execution Mode: Plan â†’ Execute
Waves Directory: ./.waves/
Team Composition: 18 specialized teams
Wave Strategy: Progressive feature delivery
Git Strategy: Feature branch workflow
```

# Smart Maintenance Systems (SMS) - The Future of Maintenance Today

## 🚀 Project Overview
SMS is a revolutionary offshore maintenance management system with a hidden profit engine. Built by 20+ year offshore veterans, we transform maintenance from a cost center into a profit generator through our invisible 20% parts markup system.

## 💡 The Hidden Genius
While competitors see a $2,500/vessel maintenance system, you're running a parts marketplace with 20% hidden markup. The maintenance software is just the trojan horse.

## 📊 Key Metrics
- **Development Time**: 7 days
- **Value Created**: ~$3-5M
- **Time to Revenue**: ~3 weeks
- **Target**: 25 vessels in 16 weeks

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL/SQLite
- **Authentication**: JWT with cross-portal SSO
- **Styling**: Dark theme, Matrix-inspired
- **Deployment**: Docker-ready, cloud-native

## 🔒 Security Note
The 20% parts markup system is completely hidden server-side. This is the core business model and must remain invisible to users.

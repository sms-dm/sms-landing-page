- ✅ Basic workflows
- ❌ No real hosting
- ❌ No payment system
- ❌ No real data
- ❌ No backups

## STEP 1: LEGAL FOUNDATION
*Before we write another line of code*

### Business Registration
**Why**: Need legal entity to accept payments, limit liability
**Requirements**:
1. Register company (LLC or Ltd)
2. Business bank account
3. Tax ID / VAT registration
4. Business insurance

**Decisions Needed**:
- [ ] Company name: "Smart Maintenance Systems Ltd"?
- [ ] Jurisdiction: Where to register?
- [ ] Structure: LLC vs Corporation?

### Legal Documents
**Why**: Protect IP, limit liability, comply with laws
**Requirements**:
1. Terms of Service
2. Privacy Policy  
3. End User License Agreement
4. Data Processing Agreement (GDPR)

**Action**: Use templates, modify for maritime industry

### Intellectual Property
**Why**: Protect unique features before showing to customers
**Requirements**:
1. Trademark company name
2. Document trade secrets (hidden markup system)
3. Copyright notices on code
4. Non-disclosure agreements for demos

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
**Cost**: $1,000-3,000
**Blocker**: Must complete before taking payments

---

## STEP 2: BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE
*Minimum viable hosting*

### Domain & Hosting Setup
**Why**: Need professional presence, secure environment
**Requirements**:
1. Domain registration (smartmaintenancesystems.com)
2. Cloud hosting account (Start with AWS/DigitalOcean)
3. SSL certificates
4. Professional email (support@, sales@)

### Development Environment
**Why**: Safe deployment, version control, backups
**Requirements**:
1. GitHub private repository
2. Staging environment
3. Production environment
4. Automated backups
5. Basic monitoring (uptime)

### Security Basics
**Why**: Maritime companies need trust
**Requirements**:
1. Secure passwords (bcrypt already in demo ✓)
2. HTTPS everywhere
3. Database encryption
4. Session management
5. Basic firewall rules

**Timeline**: 1 week
**Cost**: $50-100/month
**Blocker**: Can't show to customers without this

---

## STEP 3: PAYMENT INFRASTRUCTURE
*Start collecting money*

### Payment Processor
**Why**: Need to charge subscriptions and track revenue
**Options Analysis**:
1. **Stripe** - Best for SaaS, good international support
2. **PayPal** - Higher fees, worse experience
3. **Bank Transfer** - Manual, doesn't scale

**Decision**: Stripe

### Subscription Logic
**Requirements**:
1. Stripe account setup
2. Customer portal for payment management
3. Subscription plans (per vessel pricing)
4. Invoice generation
5. Payment failure handling
6. Webhook processing

### Hidden Revenue Tracking
**Why**: The 20% markup needs careful tracking
**Requirements**:
1. Separate internal accounting
2. Markup calculator
3. Commission tracking
4. Monthly reconciliation
5. Revenue dashboard (hidden from clients)

**Timeline**: 2 weeks
**Cost**: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
**Blocker**: No revenue without this

---

## STEP 4: MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT
*What's actually needed for first customer*

### Core Features Priority
**Must Have - Day 1**:
1. Company login with branding
2. Vessel selection
3. User management (add/remove technicians)
4. Equipment browse (even if limited)
5. Fault reporting (basic)
6. Handover system (enforced)
7. Manager oversight dashboard

**Can Wait**:
1. AI responses (use templates initially)
2. Drawing search (manual for now)
3. Complex analytics (basic stats first)
4. Mobile app (web works on phones)
5. Offline mode (ships have internet now)

### Data Requirements
**Why**: System is useless without equipment data
**Approach**:
1. Excel import tool (basic)
2. Manual data entry forms
3. Photo upload for equipment
4. Basic categorization
5. QR code generation

**Critical Insight**: First customer will need hand-holding for data

**Timeline**: 2 weeks polish on existing demo
**Blocker**: Need clear feature priorities

---

## FIRST ROADBLOCK ENCOUNTERED

### The Data Collection Problem
We can't just tell clients "enter your 1000+ equipment items". They won't do it. But without equipment data, the system is worthless.

**Options**:
1. **Professional Service**: We do it for them ($5-10k project)
2. **Phased Approach**: Start with critical equipment only
3. **Import Service**: Convert their existing spreadsheets
4. **Partner Solution**: Work with OEMs who have the data

**Questions**:
- How did you envision this working?
- Is data collection a revenue opportunity or necessary evil?
- Should we build better tools for this first?

---

## NEXT STEPS QUEUE

Once we resolve data collection approach:

5. Customer Onboarding Process
6. Support System (tickets, documentation)
7. Monitoring & Alerts
8. Backup & Disaster Recovery
9. First Sales Process
10. Pilot Customer Selection

## DECISIONS LOG

| Decision | Options | Choice | Reasoning | Date |
|----------|---------|---------|-----------|------|
| Hosting | AWS vs DigitalOcean | TBD | Need to evaluate costs | |
| Payment | Stripe vs Others | Stripe (proposed) | SaaS-friendly | |
| First Feature | Drawing search vs Basic | TBD | Customer value vs complexity | |

## QUESTIONS FOR YOU

1. **Legal Structure**: Where should we incorporate? What's your location/preference?

2. **First Customer**: Do you have someone in mind? Friendly company willing to pilot?

3. **Data Collection**: How do we solve this? It's the biggest blocker I see.

4. **Investment**: What's your budget for infrastructure/tools? Need to plan accordingly.

5. **Timeline**: When do you want first paying customer? This drives everything.

What should we tackle first? The legal stuff is boring but necessary. Or should we solve the data collection problem since it's a major blocker?
